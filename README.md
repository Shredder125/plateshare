Livelink - https://platesharefront.netlify.app/

PlateShare is a full-stack MERN application designed to reduce food waste by connecting people with surplus food to those in need. Key features of the platform include:

User Authentication: Users can register and log in using email/password or Google authentication via Firebase. Passwords are validated for security, and private routes are protected.

Food Management: Logged-in users can add, update, or delete food items with details such as food name, quantity, pickup location, expiry date, and additional notes. Images are hosted using imgbb.

Browse & Request Food: All users can view available food items on a dynamic “Available Foods” page. Users can view detailed information and submit requests for food, which the donator can accept or reject.

Food Request System: Food owners can manage requests for their donated food, with status tracking (pending, accepted, rejected) and automatic updates to food availability.

Dynamic & Interactive UI: The homepage features a hero/banner section, featured foods, “How It Works” and “Our Mission” sections. Animations and loaders enhance user experience.

Responsive Design: Fully responsive design ensures smooth functionality across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Live Deployment: The application is deployed on Netlify (client-side) and Vercel (server-side) with all private routes maintained during page reloads.
